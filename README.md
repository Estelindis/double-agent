# About the project
Double Agent is a text-based RPG about engaging an oppressive power structure covertly from within.

## User Goals
- Explore espionage tropes, especially those involving trust, loyalty, and hidden agendas.
- Make thematically interesting choices and experience the consequences of these choices. 
- Read story text at a comfortable speed.
- Be able to save game data, so a playthrough can be resumed later.

## Owner Goals
- Present espionage tropes, combining them with fantasy tropes in an engaging manner.
- Provide a range of choices, keeping the user guessing as to what the consequences of these choices might be.
- Give the user options for controlling the speed at which new lines of text are displayed. 
- If the terminal fills up with text, allow the user to read the text at leisure before continuing.
- Provide a savegame system, so returning users don't have to start from the beginning unless they wish.
- Create a range of Python functions that will remain useful if/when the story is expanded in future.

# Code Design
Functions are designed with a view to forwards and backwards compatibility. Returning users with savegames from previous versions of the game should be able to continue their story from where they left off. Future developers should be able to add further story content without needing to write new functions.
