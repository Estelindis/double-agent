# About the project
Double Agent is a text-based RPG about engaging an oppressive power structure covertly from within.

## User Goals
- Explore espionage tropes, especially those involving trust, loyalty, and hidden agendas.
- Make thematically interesting choices and experience the consequences of these choices. 
- Read story text at a comfortable speed.
- Be able to save game data, so a playthrough can be resumed later.

## Owner Goals
- Present espionage tropes, combining them with fantasy tropes in an engaging manner.
- Present a range of choices, keeping the user guessing as to what the consequences of these choices might be.
- Provide options for controlling the speed at which new lines of text are displayed. If the terminal fills up with text without a user choice being presented, implement a pause, allowing the user to read the text at leisure before continuing.
- Provide a savegame system so returning users don't have to start from the beginning unless they wish.
- Create a range of Python functions that will remain useful if/when the story is expanded later.
